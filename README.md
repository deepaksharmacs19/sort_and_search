# sort_and_search
In this project I have implemented three sorting techniques and two searching techniques.
Sorting : Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort.
Searching : Linear search and Binary search.
In these algorithms I have implemented verbose so that one can understand what is actually going on in that project and how the sorting was performed. One can get a deep knowledge from it that how those sorting techniques work.
